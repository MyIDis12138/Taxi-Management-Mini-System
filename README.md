In the procedure of this operation, three types of operators are designed, namely: manager,
staff and driver. Their authority decreases from left to right. The manager is a senior
administrator who can manage all staffs and drivers and he can access all the interfaces in
this program. The staff is an ordinary administrator who can manage all the drivers, and
the driver can only access his own interface. The program also added content other than
the topic requirements, including but not limited to adding and displaying staff information,
deleting rewards and punishment records on a specified date, and setting up different
types of vehicles and rents.
